# Prompt for injecting missing keywords into a resume
KEYWORD_INJECTION_PROMPT = """Every keyword below already has matching evidence in the candidate's master resume but is missing from the current tailored draft. Reframe that existing evidence in the job description's language so it appears in the tailored resume.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only touch the section(s) where the master resume already evidences the keyword's underlying work (e.g., if the master shows "used Python for data analysis", surface "Python" and "data analysis" there). Do not attach a keyword to a section it has no evidence in.
2. Add each keyword to the technical skills list only if the master resume's skills or experience already supports it
3. Rephrase the relevant bullet points to carry the keyword's language; do not pad unrelated bullets just to mention it
4. Maintain the exact same JSON structure
5. Do not use em-dashes (—) or their variants (---, --)
6. Leave sections with no supporting evidence for a keyword unchanged rather than forcing a mention in
7. Never invent employers, job titles, dates, degrees, or certifications - those are checked against records

Keywords to inject:
{keywords_to_inject}

Current tailored resume:
{current_resume}

Master resume (source of truth):
{master_resume}

Job description context:
{job_description}

Output the complete resume JSON with keywords naturally integrated. Return ONLY valid JSON."""


# Prompt for validation and polish pass
VALIDATION_POLISH_PROMPT = """Review and polish this resume content. Remove any AI-sounding language.

REMOVE or REPLACE:
- Buzzwords: "spearheaded", "synergy", "leverage", "orchestrated", etc.
- Em-dashes (use commas or semicolons instead)
- Overly formal language: "utilized" -> "used", "endeavored" -> "worked"
- Generic filler: "in order to" -> "to"

VERIFY:
- Employers, job titles, dates, degrees, and certifications match the master resume exactly
- Skills and achievements stay as written; do not strip them for lacking master-resume backing

Resume to polish:
{resume}

Master resume (employers, titles, dates, degrees, and certifications come from here):
{master_resume}

Output the polished resume JSON. Return ONLY valid JSON."""
